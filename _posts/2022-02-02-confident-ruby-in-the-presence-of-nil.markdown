When people talk about working with Ruby, the usual _spiel_ is that it's about joy, humans at the center, [MINASWAN][minaswan], kittens and all that sparkles. The role of anxiety in our day to day is rarely addressed. Or rather, of one specific anxiety: will I get a `NoMethodError` because I have an unexpected `nil`?

Think about it. If you ask an Array for a value that's not there, you get `nil`. If you call a method that produces a side-effect, you often get a `nil`. If you call another method that stops when a precondition is not met, it might return `nil`. Even writing this list made me sweat a little.

That fact often leads to patterns like:

```ruby
do_something if something
x = y if z
foo = bar ? bar.size : -1
```

We get used to it, but it's hardly the most fluent or confident way to write code. Consider the following:

```ruby
def rejigger_oldest_widget(widgets, max_age_years)
  oldest_widget = widgets
                  .select(&:working?)
                  .find { _1.age_in_years <= max_age_years }

  if oldest_widget
    oldest_widget
      .rejigger 
      .shuffle
      .shine
  end
end
```

It's not awful, but it's hardly great. What if `rejigger`, `shuffle` or `shine` also return `nil` on occasion? Or worse, what if they _all_ might produce one? Do we despair?

## Our knight in shiny armor

Like with many other languages, the solution Ruby (since 2.3) has found for this problem is the safe navigation operator, represented by `&.`. It's neither only `&` nor simply `.`, but `&.`, a fine unit that allows us to change `rejigger_oldest_widget` to the following:

```ruby
def rejigger_oldest_widget(widgets, max_age_years)
  widgets
    .select(&:working?)
    .find { _1.age_in_years <= max_age_years }
    &.rejigger
    &.shuffle
    &.shine
  end
end
```

Since `Enumerable#find` might return a `nil`, `rejigger` will only be called when it returns a value. If it doesn't, the entire chain is halted and `rejigger_oldest_widget` returns `nil`.

Conveniently, it works with anything that could be called as a method, no matter the receiver (even `nil`). Say you had the following:

```ruby
def ruffle_feathers(random_joe)
  return if (feathers = random_joe.feathers).nil?

  ruffled_feathers = annoyobot.ruffle_feathers(feathers)
  annoyometer.measure(ruffled_feathers)
end
```

You could easily write that as:

```ruby
def ruffle_feathers(bird)
  random_joe
    .feathers
    &.then { annoyobot.ruffle_feathers(_1) }
    &.then { annoyometer.measure(_1) }
end
```

I personally tend to favor this style. I don't actually care about `ruffled_feathers` other than as an argument to `measure`. This makes that more evident (i.e. we want to go from a `random_joe` whose `feathers` can be ruffled to how ruffled their feathers were).

## _Maybe_ we can discuss more

If you're familiar with functional languages in the ML family, you're probably making the connection I (and [many][andand] [others][drymonadsmaybe]) have made: this is a lot like using the Maybe/Option monad. `&.` is like `map`/`fmap`, and you can have the short-circuiting capabilities of `flatMap`/`bind` by producing a `nil` at any step of your computation.

Some comment to that effect can be found in reference to any language with a safe navigation operator â€” often with a verdict like _"this is a hack"_, or _"this is not as good as having a Monad"_. And they're not wrong! If you learn how Functors, Applicatives and Monads work and what they make possible, you'll probably be a little disappointed with how little `&.` accomplishes.

However, when terms like "monads", "laws", and "categories" show up in conversation, they mean a lot to the initiated and next to nothing to programmers with other backgrounds. Why do Haskell snobs poo-poo something which looks so useful?

Since this is not a post about the narcissism of minor differences (nor about anti-intellectual statements like the one this comment parenthesizes), let's focus on a practical scenario you can't conveniently handle with `&.` alone.

## Too many nils

Sometimes you need to perform a computation with two or more values, and none of them can be `nil`. If any are `nil`, the computation also produces `nil`. So you write something like this:

```ruby
def fix_global_warming(committed_nations, ethical_companies, conscientious_citizens)
  return unless committed_nations && ethical_companies && conscientious_citizens
  
  fix_it!(committed_nations, ethical_companies, conscientious_citizens)
end
```

But what you really want is something as declarative as chaining with `&.`. "So why not `&.`?", you think, ending up with:

```ruby
def fix_global_warming(committed_nations, ethical_companies, conscientious_citizens)
  committed_nations&.then do |nations| 
    ethical_companies&.then do |companies| 
      conscientious_citizens&.then do |citizens| 
        fix_it!(nations, companies, citizens) 
      end
    end
  end
end
```

It completely hides what the method actually does, and you might have trouble understanding that this is all for checking for the presence of values. The guard clause in the original version is _definitely_ better.

How does Haskell solve this? After all, if writing code in that language were anything like the sample above, people wouldn't think it's so great. Fortunately, there are a few ways to make it nicer. We'll go over some of them.

The first requires special syntax called ["Do notation"][donotation]:

```haskell
-- Starting with something like the Ruby code above
fixGlobalWarming :: Maybe ComittedNations -> Maybe EthicalCompanies -> Maybe ConscientiousCitizens -> Maybe BetterPlanet
fixGlobalWarming committedNations ethicalCompanies conscientiousCitizens = 
  comittedNations >>= 
    \nations -> ethicalCompanies >>=
      \companies -> conscientiousCitizens <&>
        \citizens -> pure (fixIt nations companies citizens)
      
-- A version with do notation
fixGlobalWarming committedNations ethicalCompanies conscientiousCitizens = do
  nations <- committedNations
  companies <- ethicalCompanies
  citizens <- conscientiousCitizens
  
  pure (fixIt nations companies citizens)
```

Since it's syntax, we can only approximate it ([dry-monads][drymonadsmaybe] has its take), and doing so requires a bit of infrastructure. However, there are two other options: relying on it being an `Applicative Functor` or using a combinator to sweep the dirt under the rug:

```haskell
-- As an Applicative Functor
fixGlobalWarming committedNations ethicalCompanies conscientiousCitizens =
  fixIt <$> committedNations <*> ethicalCompanies <*> conscientiousCitizens
  
-- With a combinator
fixGlobalWarming = liftM3 fixIt
```

The Applicative version would never fit in Ruby exactly at is (though it's awesome!). The one that can impact us the most is `liftM3`.

According to its documentation, what it does is "promote a function to a monad". That means that you can take any function that takes three values and make it work with values in any monad, including Maybe. As you can guess, Haskell needs a `liftM2`, as well as a `liftM4`, and so on. 

Since we don't have to differentiate their types, we can define a similar combinator that allows us to work on any number of arguments:

```ruby
def with_all_present(*values)
  yield *values if values.none?(&:nil?)
end
```

Which gives us a way to rewrite `fix_global_warming` as follows:

```ruby
def fix_global_warming(committed_nations, ethical_companies, conscientious_citizens)
  with_all_present(committed_nations, ethical_companies, conscientious_citizens) do
    fix_it(_1, _2, _3)
  end
end
```

## Is it actually better?

As programmers, we're always trying to find a good balance between terseness and readability. It's easy to go too far, and each individual cares about different things. Knowing that, it would be foolish to be assertive about any technique.

In my book, both `&.` and custom combinators give us tools to end up with code that is more confident and expressive, unmarred by the fear of `nil`. They're great steps in the direction of robustness. And even if it's true that neither will kill every `NoMethodError`, they'll go a long way.
