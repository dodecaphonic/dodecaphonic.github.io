On June 21th, 2014, I gave a talk about Functional Programming in Ruby in one of [RubyOnRio's][rubyonrio] monthly meetings. I decided to do a short overview of some concepts and techniques in the FP world and then go over [Gary Bernhardt's][garyb] "[Functional Core, Imperative Shell][funcoreimpshell]" &mdash; after all, it would be a hard sell if I couldn't show a way said techniques make your everyday coding better.

It didn't get recorded this time, but I thought the slides could be interesting. Here they are.
