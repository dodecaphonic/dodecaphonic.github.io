    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As time goes by, Ruby moves closer and closer to the &ldquo;boring tech&rdquo; bin: it&rsquo;s tried, true and trite (at least by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> standards). And to be completely honest, I&rsquo;ve often been taken by that same sentiment. The awareness of the privilege to be working with something that remains foreign to most of the Brazilian market has been replaced by a feeling of &ldquo;not cool enough&rdquo;, an anxiety for something as wonderful to happen again.</p>

<p>Analyzing things more carefully, however, I&rsquo;ve realized how much it has allowed me to change as a coder. In Ruby, it&rsquo;s very easy to go from &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like this in language <em>x</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like this in Ruby, too.&rdquo; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re">&ldquo;Belle marquise&rdquo;</a> quality of expression it allows is a source of many joys, and can be quite invigorating as the relationship between it and the programmer develops.</p>

<p>We often feel pressured, in our field, to jump from thing to thing, from shiny to shiny, from silver bullet to silver bullet. &ldquo;The best tool for the job cannot possibly be the tool you had five years ago&rdquo; &mdash; chants the crowd as they try a new JavaScript build system &mdash; &ldquo;it just isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; Reflecting on the role Ruby has had in my life, though, shines light on an aspect we rarely explore: a programming language is a friend. It&rsquo;s not perfect, it can annoy you, but it&rsquo;s there, and by merely being there and helping you think it makes you better.</p>

<p>Ruby is a <em>great</em> friend. We&rsquo;ve been together for almost ten years. I can only hope I&rsquo;ve been making it better too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On June 21th, 2014, I gave a talk about Functional Programming in Ruby in one of <a href="http://rubyonrio.org">RubyOnRio&rsquo;s</a> monthly meetings. I decided to do a short overview of some concepts and techniques in the FP world and then go over <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell">Functional Core, Imperative Shell</a>&rdquo; &mdash; after all, it would be a hard sell if I couldn&rsquo;t show a way said techniques make your everyday coding better.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t get recorded this time, but I thought the slides could be interesting. Here they are.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-02T10:32:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://troikatech.com/blog/2014/04/02/property-based-testing-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past year or so I have slowly been dipping my feet into the vast functional programming seas. From taking the awesome <a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">offerings</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">from Typesafe</a> to slowly working through RÃºnar Bjarnason&rsquo;s and Paul Chiusano&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/">Functional Programming in Scala</a></em>, my mind has been expanding proportionally to the time I dedicate to learning its ways. It has been incredibly rewarding and humbling.</p>

<p>One such reward has been coming into direct touch with property-based testing. This technique, first developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> in Haskell-land, spins automated testing on its head: instead of codifying what is proper behavior by asserting that the outputs for given inputs match what is expected, the tester establishes logical properties about what should happen and lets the tool generate loads of inputs to check if they hold. If something goes wrong, the tool will then try to find the smallest test input that breaks the property (<em>falsifies</em> it), a process called <em>shrinking</em>; if it can&rsquo;t find anything, you can sigh with relief and think about what to scrutinize next.</p>

<p>Having a QuickCheck-like tool at your disposal can be incredibly powerful. The more complex the software or the algorithm, the greater the likelihood of your carefully curated unit and integration tests having blind spots. <a href="http://basho.com">Basho</a>, for instance, <a href="http://basho.com/quickchecking-poolboy-for-fun-and-profit/">have written about the stark realization that their worker pool library was full of subtle bugs by using QuickCheck for Erlang</a>, and you can find <a href="http://www.quviq.com/documents/erlang001-arts.pdf">other</a> <a href="http://www.autosar.org/download/conferencedocs11/12_AUTOSAR_ModelBased_Quviq.pdf">instances</a> of how the technique helped make better software.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I come in contact with stuff like that I immediately think of how improved parts of my day job would be if I just could apply it. Considering that my daily duties are conducted in Ruby, I felt it was time I explored the subject in that realm.</p>

<h2>A contrived setup that hopefully shows how it can work out</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;ve decided to implement our own linked list class in Ruby. We would probably start our implementation with something like this:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb</a>
require &ldquo;singleton&rdquo;</p>

<p>class Nil
  include Singleton</p>

<p>  def empty?; true; end</p>

<p>  def to_s</p>

<pre><code>"Nil"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class Cons
  def initialize(head, tail = Nil.instance)</p>

<pre><code>@head = head
@tail = tail
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  attr_reader :head, :tail</p>

<p>  def empty?; false; end</p>

<p>  def to_s</p>

<pre><code>"(#{head} . #{tail.to_s})"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Using that <em>very</em> convenient API, we can build lists:</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>l = Cons.new(1, Cons.new(2, Cons.new(3, Nil.instance)))
l.to_s # => &ldquo;(1 . (2 . (3 . Nil)))&rdquo;
```</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>We know that, in a linked list, adding to the head is O(1), while appending to the end is O(n). So we build algorithms that respect its efficiency guarantees. However, when we, say, map this list into another list, it results in the following situation:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb</a>
def do_something_amazing(list, acc = Nil.instance)
  super_value = list.head * 1337
  if list.tail.empty?</p>

<pre><code>acc
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>do_something_amazing(list.tail, List.new(super_value, acc))
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>do_something(l).to_s # => &ldquo;(4011 . (2674 . (1337 . Nil)))&rdquo;
```</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Processing things from head to tail means the list ends up reversed. It&rsquo;s common, then, to reverse it back when we&rsquo;re done processing, to preserve the order an external user would expect. Let&rsquo;s add a <code>reverse</code> method to a <code>List</code> helper module:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb</a>
module List
  def self.reverse(list, acc = Nil.instance)</p>

<pre><code>if list.empty?
  acc
else
  reverse(list.tail, Cons.new(list.head, acc))
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>So when we try to reverse what was created in <code>do_something_amazing</code>, we get what we need:</p>

<p><code>ruby
List.reverse(do_something_amazing(l)).to_s # =&gt; "(1337 . (2674 . (4011 . Nil)))"
</code></p>

<p>Awesome. I think this is enough for us to start exploring properties. If you&rsquo;re getting bored, take a sip of coffee and come back when you&rsquo;re ready. There&rsquo;s a few cool tricks below the fold.</p>

<h2>Testing the old way</h2>

<p>Being the good developers we are, we are covering that code with tests:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List Tests&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list_test-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list_test-rb</a>
class ListTest &lt; MiniTest::Test
  def test_reversing_lists</p>

<pre><code>assert_equal "(3 . (2 . (1 . Nil)))",
  List.reverse(Cons.new(1, Cons.new(2, Cons.new(3)))).to_s
assert_equal "(9 . (400 . (321 . (1 . (10 . Nil)))))",
  List.reverse(Cons.new(10, Cons.new(1, Cons.new(321, Cons.new(400, Cons.new(9)))))).to_s
assert_equal "Nil", List.reverse(Nil.instance).to_s
assert_equal "(1 . Nil)", List.reverse(Cons.new(1)).to_s
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re pretty confident that&rsquo;s enough, even if it was kind of boring to do manually. That amount of testing would let us go home and sleep soundly.</p>

<h2>Testing the QuickCheck way</h2>

<p>First, we&rsquo;ll need something like QuickCheck in Ruby. The best, most idiomatic, most maintained, least-Monad-y thing I have found is <a href="https://github.com/hayeah/rantly">Rantly</a>. It has both primitive value generation built-in and property testing with shrinking. We&rsquo;ll skip over the basic API and go straight to defining a property to check if my algorithm is really bullet-proof. To aid in the creation of lists from Arrays, we&rsquo;ll add a new helper:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list-rb</a>
module List
  # &hellip;
  def self.from_values(*values)</p>

<pre><code>values.reverse.inject(Nil.instance) { |ls, v| Cons.new(v, ls) }
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>To check that it works, let&rsquo;s change the existing tests and see if they still pass:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List Tests&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list_test-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list_test-rb</a>
class ListTest &lt; MiniTest::Test
  def test_reversing_lists</p>

<pre><code>assert_equal "(3 . (2 . (1 . Nil)))",
  List.reverse(List.from_values(1, 2, 3)).to_s
assert_equal "(9 . (400 . (321 . (1 . (10 . Nil)))))",
  List.reverse(List.from_values(10, 1, 321, 400, 9)).to_s
assert_equal "Nil", List.reverse(Nil.instance).to_s
assert_equal "(1 . Nil)", List.reverse(List.from_values(1)).to_s
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>```
Run options: &mdash;seed 48889</p>

<h1>Running:</h1>

<p>.</p>

<p>Finished in 0.001256s, 796.1783 runs/s, 3184.7134 assertions/s.</p>

<p>1 runs, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```</p>

<p>Great. Now to the newfangled thing. As I mentioned before, writing a property to check requires us to think differently than we would with regular unit tests. Your formulation should state something logical, something that does not rely on specific inputs. Following that guideline, we can reason about reversing lists in the following manner:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List Tests&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list2_test-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list2_test-rb</a>
  # &hellip;
  def test_reversing_by_property</p>

<pre><code>property {
  length = range(0, 1_000_000)
  List.from_values(array(length) { integer })
}.check { |list|
  assert_equal list.to_s, List.reverse(List.reverse(list)).to_s
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # &hellip;
```</p>

<p>The meat is in the <code>check</code> block. Determining that a list has been reversed correctly requires us to check if reversing it again gets us back to the original list. To seed our check, we build a <code>property</code> block that creats an array with a random length between 0 and 1_000_000, itself filled with random integers. Let&rsquo;s run the tests again:</p>

<p>```
$ bundle exec ruby list.rb
Run options: &mdash;seed 17130</p>

<h1>Running:</h1>

<p>.
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
success: 100 tests
.</p>

<p>Finished in 121.969127s, 0.0164 runs/s, 0.8527 assertions/s.</p>

<p>2 runs, 104 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```</p>

<p>It took a while (we wanted to be thorough, with those million-item arrays), but we&rsquo;re pretty sure it works. I&rsquo;m a believer and I&rsquo;m stoked; when I look at you, however, I see a face that says &ldquo;look, it&rsquo;s cool and all, but isn&rsquo;t it <em>kind of worthless</em>? The tests we had were telling us the same thing, and we only needed the power of our minds to generate the correct inputs. Why go through so much trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, what about those times when ours minds fail us?</p>

<h2>Catching a bug with Rantly</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re excited about building your own data structures and want to wrap that linked list inside a very inefficient Set. You mutter to yourself that you should make sure items are not inserted twice, which for now seems to be the main difference between Sets and Lists as storage containers.</p>

<p>You build a little more structure into what you already have, adding a <code>prepend</code> method and inlining <code>reverse</code> into a <code>List</code> base class:</p>

<p>```ruby &ldquo;List 2&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list2-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list2-rb</a></p>

<p>class List
  def to_s</p>

<pre><code>raise "Don't use this directly, fool"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def empty?; true; end</p>

<p>  def prepend(v)</p>

<pre><code>Cons.new(v, self)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def reverse(acc = Nil.instance)</p>

<pre><code>if empty?
  acc
else
  tail.reverse(Cons.new(head, acc))
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.from_values(*values)</p>

<pre><code>values.reverse.inject(Nil.instance) { |ls, v| Cons.new(v, ls) }
</code></pre>

<p>  end<br/>
end</p>

<p>class Nil &lt; List
  include Singleton</p>

<p>  def to_s</p>

<pre><code>"Nil"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class Cons &lt; List
  def initialize(head, tail = Nil.instance)</p>

<pre><code>@head = head
@tail = tail
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  attr_reader :head, :tail</p>

<p>  def empty?; false; end</p>

<p>  def to_s</p>

<pre><code>"(#{head} . #{tail.to_s})"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>To check if an item exists, you add a <code>contains?</code> method:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;List with contains&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list2-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-list2-rb</a>
class List
  # ..
  def contains?(v); false; end
  # ..
end</p>

<p>class Cons &lt; List
  # ..
  def contains?(v)</p>

<pre><code>head == v || tail.contains?(v)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # ..
end
```</p>

<p>Then you write your immutable Set and matching tests:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;A dumb set implementation&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-set-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-set-rb</a>
class DumbSet
  def initialize(storage = Nil.instance)</p>

<pre><code>@storage = storage
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  attr_reader :storage
  private     :storage</p>

<p>  def push(v)</p>

<pre><code>if !storage.contains?(v)
  DumbSet.new(storage.prepend(v))
else
  self
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  alias_method :&lt;&lt;, :push</p>

<p>  def contains?(v)</p>

<pre><code>storage.contains?(v)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def to_a</p>

<pre><code>values = []
list   = storage
until list.empty?
  values &lt;&lt; list.head
  list = list.tail
end
values
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class DumbSetTest &lt; Minitest::Test
  def setup</p>

<pre><code>@s = (((DumbSet.new &lt;&lt; 1) &lt;&lt; 2) &lt;&lt; 3)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  attr_reader :s</p>

<p>  def test_contains</p>

<pre><code>assert s.contains?(3)
assert s.contains?(2)
assert s.contains?(1)
assert !s.contains?(4)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def test_uniqueness</p>

<pre><code>assert_equal [-32, 1, 2, 3], (s &lt;&lt; -32 &lt;&lt; -32 &lt;&lt; -32).to_a.sort
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>And because I spotted you writing new code and yelled &ldquo;HEY USE RANTLY IT&rsquo;S SO COOL YIPEE&rdquo;, you add some property tests:</p>

<p>``` ruby
class DumbSetTest &lt; Minitest::Test
  # &hellip;
def test_contains_property</p>

<pre><code>property {
  array(range(0, 100)) { integer }
}.check { |vs|
  s = vs.inject(DumbSet.new) { |ds, v| ds &lt;&lt; v }
  assert vs.all? { |v| s.contains?(v) }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def test_uniqueness_property</p>

<pre><code>property {
  array(range(0, 100)) { integer }
}.check { |vs|
  ns = vs.inject(DumbSet.new) { |ds, v| ds &lt;&lt; v }
  rs = vs.inject(ns) { |ds, v| ds &lt;&lt; v }
  assert_equal vs.sort, ns.to_a.sort
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # &hellip;
end<br/>
```</p>

<p>It looks good:</p>

<p>```
$ bundle exec ruby set_test.rb
Run options: &mdash;seed 15625</p>

<h1>Running:</h1>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
success: 100 tests
..
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
success: 100 tests
..</p>

<p>Finished in 0.119717s, 33.4121 runs/s, 1720.7247 assertions/s.</p>

<p>4 runs, 206 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```</p>

<p>You then implement the removal of items:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;Set with delete&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-set-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-set-rb</a>
class DumbSet
  # &hellip;
  def delete(v)</p>

<pre><code>ls = storage
ns = DumbSet.new

while !ls.empty?
  if ls.head != v
    ns = ns &lt;&lt; v
  end

  ls = ls.tail
end

ns
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # &hellip;
end</p>

<p>class DumbSetTest &lt; Minitest::TestCase
  # &hellip;
  def test_delete</p>

<pre><code>os = (((DumbSet.new &lt;&lt; 1) &lt;&lt; 2) &lt;&lt; 3)
ns = os.delete(1337)
assert_equal [1, 2, 3], ns.to_a.sort
ns = os.delete(3)
assert_equal [1, 2], ns.to_a.sort
ns = ns.delete(2)
assert_equal [1], ns.to_a.sort
ns = (ns &lt;&lt; 432).delete(1)
assert_equal [432], ns.to_a.sort
ns = ns.delete(432)
assert_equal [], ns.to_a.sort
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # &hellip;
end
```</p>

<p>Your tests pass, but this time you don&rsquo;t listen to me about adding another property. You&rsquo;re just not that convinced they&rsquo;re worth their salt, and it looks good enough to ship with all the tests you&rsquo;ve added. The PokÃ©mon Collecting app you work on can benefit from it right now, instead of 20 minutes from now. To production it goes.</p>

<p>Time goes by, and you&rsquo;ve forgotten about me and our little adventure. Your system is humming along and moved on to maintenance mode. Days have been kind of slow, so you decide to add an optimization you&rsquo;ve read about in Hacker News, detailing how a node.js program got a 10x speedup. You modify your delete method accordingly:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;Set Tests&rdquo; <a href="https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-set_test-rb">https://gist.github.com/dodecaphonic/9934064#file-set_test-rb</a>
  # &hellip;
  def delete(v)</p>

<pre><code>ls  = storage
tmp = DumbSet.new

while !ls.empty?
  if (ls.head != v) &amp;&amp; (ls.head &lt; 1500) # secret performance trick
    tmp = tmp &lt;&lt; ls.head
  end

  ls = ls.tail
end

tmp
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  # &hellip;
```</p>

<p>CI still reports all green.</p>

<p>A few days later, you receive a report from a User telling she deleted their PokÃ©mon with power level 3, but her PokÃ©mons with levels 4013, 1551 and 20000 disappeared. Your first line of defense &mdash; your tests &mdash; have not caught any issues. Sweating bullets and drowning in emails from stakeholders and other PokÃ©mon fiends, you&rsquo;re about to collapse.</p>

<p>And then you remember: what about trying to express a property to see if it holds?</p>

<p>``` ruby
  # We&rsquo;ll add at most 10 unique items and then delete the first
  # 2. If there&rsquo;s anything wrong, this will blow up.
  def test_delete_property</p>

<pre><code>property {
  array(10) { range(0, 5000) }.uniq
}.check { |values|
  os = values.inject(DumbSet.new) { |s, v| s &lt;&lt; v }
  ds = values[0..1].inject(os) { |s, v| s.delete(v) }
  assert_equal (values.size - 2), ds.to_a.size
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>You run it and it explodes:</p>

<p>```
$ bundle exec ruby set_test.rb

Expected: 8
  Actual: 2</p>

<p>6 runs, 211 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```</p>

<p>What? How come you&rsquo;ve only got 2 when you expected 8? Well, there must be something wrong with delete, after all. Let&rsquo;s take that array and try it on an <em>pry</em> session to see what happens:</p>

<p><code>
[1] pry(main)&gt; values = [384, 437, 120, 718, 1850, 4579, 3178, 4191, 533, 2669]
=&gt; [384, 437, 120, 718, 1850, 4579, 3178, 4191, 533, 2669]
[2] pry(main)&gt; os = values.inject(DumbSet.new) { |s, v| s &lt;&lt; v }
=&gt; #&lt;DumbSet...&gt;
[3] pry(main)&gt; values[0..1].inject(os) { |s, v| s.delete(v) }.to_a
=&gt; [718, 533]
</code></p>

<p>Wait a minute! Should delete also remove everything that&rsquo;s over 1000-ish? Is there anything in the code that stipulates such a thing? Maybe that node.js optimization was not so great after all. Let&rsquo;s remove it and run the tests:</p>

<p>```
$ bundle exec ruby set_test.rb
Run options: &mdash;seed 2727</p>

<h1>Running:</h1>

<p>.

```</p>

<p>VoilÃ : properties have saved the day, and you&rsquo;ve learned not to trust Hacker News bravado ever again.</p>

<h2>Is using Rantly the same as using QuickCheck or ScalaCheck?</h2>

<p>Sort of. For one, you have to write your own generators every time you want something other than basic types, while both QuickCheck and ScalaCheck can figure out a lot by themselves. This can make expressing what you mean a lot easier, and you don&rsquo;t spend time debugging your <code>property</code> blocks in search of mistakes. That said, writing a generator for your own types requires only that you instantiate them in the <code>property</code> blocks with other auto-generated values.</p>

<p>Shrinking is not as good in Rantly. It works ok a lot of the time, but it could be improved. On the surface, from skimming the algorithms used in ScalaCheck and Rantly, it doesn&rsquo;t <em>seem</em> that different, but over that side of the line the patterns in minimization seem easier to spot.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also no mechanism to test stateful code. ScalaCheck has <a href="https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck/wiki/User-Guide#stateful-testing">Commands</a> to help in modeling state changes, and I&rsquo;m aware <a href="https://github.com/manopapad/proper">PropEr</a> and <a href="http://www.quviq.com/">QuickCheck for Erlang</a> also provide something in that direction.</p>

<p>One minor thing is that integration with RSpec and MiniTest could be improved. Its output pollutes the test run, and on large suites it becomes hard to know the relationship between a failed property and a failed test. It should be easy to fix for anyone motivated. On that note, there&rsquo;s no ready-made extension for MiniTest (although adding one is trivial enough that I&rsquo;m sending a PR to fix it).</p>

<h2>Final considerations</h2>

<p>I hope I have proven, even if with a craptastic example, that property-testing can aid you in writing better Ruby code. Our community is great when it comes to using tests both as a design and as a verification tool, and QuickCheck (via Rantly) is a new way of thinking about them. You should keep your TDD/BDD to carve out your objects and responsibilities, but also add property checks where suitable to strengthen your confidence in the system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No dia 15 de marÃ§o de 2014, aproveitei o encontro do <a href="http://rubyonrio.org">RubyOnRio</a> para falar sobre <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid">Celluloid</a>, uma implementaÃ§Ã£o do Actor Model para Ruby. Como programaÃ§Ã£o reativa, concorrÃªncia, paralelismo e quetais tÃªm ocupado minha mente nos Ãºltimos meses, achei por bem conversar com o pessoal sobre como isso Ã© relevante para o futuro do desenvolvimento de software e para o Ruby em si, constantemente sob ameaÃ§a (se Hacker News for parÃ¢metro) de ser soterrado por uma tecnologia mais antenada com os novos tempos.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="7acca2a0935901315c4a3abe98d15494" data-ratio="1.34031413612565" src="http://troikatech.com//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>A ideia da minha apresentaÃ§Ã£o foi dar uma pincelada nos problemas clÃ¡ssicos de threading, explicar <em>en passant</em> as ideias do Actor Model, e por fim encerrar na aplicaÃ§Ã£o disso dentro do Celluloid. Claro que hÃ¡ informaÃ§Ãµes vitais que ficaram de fora, que a superficialidade pode ser criticada, que o palestrante Ã© meio capenga, mas espero que no cÃ´mputo geral o resultado tenha agradado.</p>

<p>Por fim apresentei um projetinho que fiz especialmente para o encontro, o <a href="https://github.com/dodecaphonic/balladina-ruby">Balladina</a>. Foi divertido fazÃª-lo, e aprendi bastante coisa sobre o Celluloid no processo. Pude tambÃ©m contrastar algumas coisas com a parca experiÃªncia que tive com o Akka no <a href="/blog/2014/01/12/reactive/">curso do Coursera</a>, e a maturidade do Celluloid relativa Ã  do Akka me deixou esperanÃ§oso de um futuro bacana no Ruby. Vamos torcer pelo melhor.</p>

    <link href="http://troikatech.com/blog/2014/02/26/websocket-webmachine/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-26T09:03:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://troikatech.com/blog/2014/02/26/websocket-webmachine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At my main job, we have a large datastructure that takes considerable CPU time to be built, but remains unchanged thereafter. Its job is to geocode positions to and from a local reference system, which in turn provides us the ability to pin records, for instance, to a place on a Road, and know to which coordinate pair a local reference would correspond.</p>

<p>For the first pass, I built the Ruby library for the geocoding and a simple (Sinatra-based) webservice. This worked fine for a while until the Client required that <strong>every</strong> mouse move performed a conversion. Said change, prompted me to build the same geocoding infrastructure again in JavaScript, and all were happy for a while.</p>

<p>As it usually goes, a new decision was made to support multiple Roads per User. Now, a download of 800KB of data (stored in an IndexedDB for later sessions) was tolerable; potentially multiple megabytes would be deadly, even if the software could be used before that constant feedback of conversions was given &mdash; it just became one of those features Users hold on to.</p>

<p>I knew that we had to go for a solution that kept that intact and made the whole thing manageable. I had dabbled in WebSockets before (with <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a>) and kind of knew the lay of the land. Still, from previous searches, I was also aware there was a dearth of Ruby solutions, and for a moment considered going with my JavaScript port on node. The thought gave me shivers.</p>

<h2>The contenders</h2>

<p>The first step was finding out what could be used. This is what I evaluated:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/simulacre/sinatra-websocket">sinatra-websocket</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-ruby">faye-websocket</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/websocket-rails/websocket-rails">websocket-rails</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ngauthier/tubesock">tubesock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby">webmachine-ruby</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The first three are EventMachine-based; <em>tubesock</em> uses <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/23/the-new-rack-socket-hijacking-api/">rack hijacking</a>; <em>webmachine-ruby</em> provides WebSockets via <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/reel">Reel</a>, a Celluloid::IO-based HTTP server.</p>

<p>At first, considering I was already using Sinatra, I tried <em>sinatra-websocket</em>. For some reason I just couldn&rsquo;t get the connection to be upgraded to a WebSocket, and decided to move on quickly. <em>faye-websocket</em> I just skipped, to be frank.</p>

<p>The next two suffered from the same problem: after booting Rails and loading the structure, I was left with only enough memory for a couple dozen or so clients on a small Heroku dyno. Also, Rails' boot time coupled with building the thing occasionally made Heroku think something had gone wrong, and often the process crashed before the service went up.</p>

<p>The only one left, if you&rsquo;re counting, was <em>webmachine-ruby</em>.</p>

<h2>webmachine-ruby</h2>

<p>Setting up was relatively easy. To ramp up, I first migrated the original HTTP-based service to its resource structure. It has more of an OO flair than both Rails and Sinatra, with the caveat that it provides a lot less (by design). The dispatcher is easy to understand, and I quite enjoyed toying with the <a href="https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby#visual-debugger">visual debugger</a>.</p>

<p>Moving to a WebSocket, however, changes everything. As far as I can tell (and the documentation specifies) you completely skip over the regular infrastructure by providing a <em>callable</em> to a configuration option, as such:</p>

<p>```
App = Webmachine::Application do |app|
  app.configure do |config|</p>

<pre><code>config.adapter = :Reel
config.adapter_options[:websocket_handler] = proc do |websocket|
  websocket &lt;&lt; "hello, world"
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>That is pretty much what the docs say. Since it only expects the handler to respond to <em>#call</em>, you can write your own <em>ad-hoc</em> dispatcher:</p>

<p>```
class WebsocketHandler
  def call(websocket)</p>

<pre><code>message = websocket.read
# do something with the message, call methods on other objects, log stuff, have your fun
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>What the docs don&rsquo;t address are some basics of sockets programming. If you see your handler hang and never respond again, requiring you to restart, don&rsquo;t fret: you just have to provide a loop to read from the the socket and let Celluloid::IO do its non-blocking magic:</p>

<p>```
class WebsocketHandler
  def call(websocket)</p>

<pre><code>loop do
  message = websocket.read
  # do something with the message, call methods on other objects, log stuff, have your fun
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry: your CPU won&rsquo;t be pegged at 100%, because non-blocking. You&rsquo;ll be subjected, however, to the same limitations node has regarding CPU usage and its event handlers (i.e. if you are CPU-intensive, you&rsquo;ll affect throughput).</p>

<p>Luckily, we have threads in Ruby. I decided to take advantage of that by assigning each client to a Celluloid Actor, which allows me to provide some of the CPU-intensive operations without compromising (at least not heavily) other Users. It has been working fine so far.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s missing</h2>

<p>My solution doesn&rsquo;t take into account non-WebSocket clients, but it should. <em>webmachine-ruby</em> makes it easy by allowing you to implement streaming APIs without much trouble, and I suppose it&rsquo;ll only take a bit of JS to fallback from one to the other and provide an abstract connection to consumers.</p>

<p>The documentation also doesn&rsquo;t go over all the events that can happen on the socket (<em>onerror</em>, <em>onclose</em>, <em>onopen</em>, <em>onmessage</em>). You can see them as methods on the socket, each taking a block, but for my use case I just let the actor crash and be done with it. If I&rsquo;m missing some cleanup, please let me know.</p>

<p>This architecture also doesn&rsquo;t provide a ready-baked pub/sub system, with channels and message brokers. If that&rsquo;s more in the spirit of what you need, check out <a href="http://faye.jcoglan.com/">faye</a> and <a href="https://github.com/websocket-rails/websocket-rails">websocket-rails</a>.</p>
