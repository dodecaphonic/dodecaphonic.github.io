</a></p>

<p>As a remote worker myself, I nodded my head frequently at the advantages and challenges presented, so the rating&rsquo;s not about a fundamental disagreement with the message or the intentions. Like the authors, I know from personal experience that commuting, facing a strict set of working hours, interruptions and living with the expectation of availability from others are some of the greatest dangers to productive work (creative work especially).</p>

<p>I did, however, expect more than short chapters and sparse data points. Maybe it&rsquo;s the programmer in me misunderstanding the whole &ldquo;business book&rdquo; thing, but perhaps the arguments would hold more weight if they were more than anedoctal. They render the whole thing as an account of what works for 37signals â€” a very small and relatively unknown company in the greater scheme of things. I understand that relying on managers and employers to be swayed by arguments from authority is antithetical to the book (the thesis being that remote work is a <em>rationally</em> better decision overall), but we cannot underestimate how many small-to-medium companies manage by emulation. Maybe stronger data and clearer research could counter gut reactions better.</p>

<p>I think this might be good if you need just a little push to go after this, if you&rsquo;re a bit on the fence and already considering/thinking this is a trend that should be studied and followed. If you want something to challenge your views with great insights, don&rsquo;t bother: it&rsquo;s fluffy and humane and beautifully illustrated, but you&rsquo;re probably going to leave the book mostly unchallenged.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I review my to-do list, there it is: &ldquo;Read SICP and do its exercises&rdquo;. That note has been there for six years, moving from productivity tool to productivity tool, never getting done. It&rsquo;s been a <em>Project</em>, a <em>Someday</em>, in <em>Inbox</em> and even in <em>Trash</em>, in fits of rage. Sometimes I think I change my to-do software just to find one that magically will make it actionable.</p>

<p>The truth is the book scares me. Reading it puts me face-to-face with my incipient Math skills, and the thought of overcoming them brings about the fear of not going through any transformations, to still be beneath the nice and impressive people I follow on Twitter and star on GitHub. Looming doom is baked into my personality, and maturity hasn&rsquo;t made me get <em>Goals</em> or appreciate what I&rsquo;ve accomplished.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m turning 30 in less than two months, and the failure is following me into a new decade. As weak as symbolic dates and its resolutions are as motivators, I really want to tick that box in the not-so-distant future. This blog will be a tale of a confused man walking through the land of Scheme, occasionally going off-topic, but always using the book as its main thread. I hope it&rsquo;s not too boring.</p>
