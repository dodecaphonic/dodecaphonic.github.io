Hi, I'm Vitor. I love software and its possibilities. My journey for the past few years has centered on how to build it better. I (sometimes) write about it here. I also discuss it in [Invi√°vel](http://inviavelpodcast.com), a podcast I record with my friend [Leonardo Couto](https://www.instagram.com/ditrospecta/).
